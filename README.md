# Bubu

Bubu is a friendly pet-themed task management chatbot. It supports to-do tasks,
deadlines, events, task search, and reminders through both a command-line
interface and a JavaFX graphical user interface.

## Setting up in Intellij

Prerequisites: JDK 25, update Intellij to the most recent version.

1. Open Intellij (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project first)
1. Open the project into Intellij as follows:
   1. Click `Open`.
   1. Select the project directory, and click `OK`.
   1. If there are any further prompts, accept the defaults.
1. Configure the project to use **JDK 25** (not other versions) as explained in [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sdk.html#set-up-jdk).<br>
   In the same dialog, set the **Project language level** field to the `SDK default` option.
1. After that, locate the `src/main/java/bubu/Launcher.java` file, right-click it, and choose `Run 'Launcher.main()'` (if the code editor is showing compile errors, try restarting the IDE). If the setup is correct, the Bubu application should start.
   ```

   | | | | | | | |/ / _ \
   | |_| | |_| |   <  __/
   |____/ \__,_|_|\_\___|
   ```

**Warning:** Keep the `src\main\java` folder as the root folder for Java files (i.e., don't rename those folders or move Java files to another folder outside of this folder path), as this is the default location some tools (e.g., Gradle) expect to find Java files.

## Credits

The initial project structure and build configuration were provided by the
NUS CS2103 project template. The Bubu application code and UI customisations
were developed for this project.
